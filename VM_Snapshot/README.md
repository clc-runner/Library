# Create Snapshots of your VM with ease!



### To create a snapshot select one of the following:
1. **By Group** -- Create a snapshot for all VMs within the group or multiple groups
2. **By Server** -- Create a snapshot for all selected servers

*Please note: Only one option can be used for creating snapshots.  This means you will need to either choose your groups or choose servers to take a snapshot of.  There is a toggle for this delineation.*
